Doctor: Keep patience, it’s only a week. You need to wait more and check the improvement because your problem is so tough and uncommon.  
Patient: What should I do now? Doctor: Have you finished the medicines that I prescribed?  
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Then, I am giving some tests here, go to the test room and do these, and I will prescribe a few more medicines after seeing the test result. Now take this paper and go for tests.  
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.
